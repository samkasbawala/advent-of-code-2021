# Advent of Code 2021
Here is my attempt of solving the puzzles that are a part of Advent of Code for 2021.
I am actually starting this after Christmas, been really busy at work. Now that I have
some time to myself, I thought I would challenge myself a bit! I actually only heard
about Advent of Code a couple weeks ago. Hopefully I'm not too rusty :P

## Language of Choice
Python, as I am the most comfortable with it.
